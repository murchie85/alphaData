# MEDICAL / ETHICAL DATA SERVICE 
  

## Core Acceptance Criterea

We want to build a useful `data platform` that users can interact with via a `web browser` and/or `mobile app`. 
 
The Web App should be an `SPA` single page applicaiton, which acts as a central dashboard with the theme of simplicity and usefulness being the priority.  

The application should  

- `pull data` from external sources.
- `clean` and `enrich` data into a new unique source
- `host` the data and accompanying items on a webpage/mobile app. 




## Use Cases and Project Ideas  
    
- Scottish GP Medical Insights  
- Mental Health Statistics (global)
- Bus timetable (Simple page: Put in my postcode and optional bus number)




  
Some inspriation to  consider:  

- ElonJet story



## TODO 

- Get some mock examples of SPAs to work to
